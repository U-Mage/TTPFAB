    <h1>TTPMTG - Magic: the Gathering for Tabletop Playground</h1>
    <h2>Version 1.1.0</h2>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome to TTPMTG, the ultimate Magic: the Gathering experience
      for Tabletop Playground!
    </p>
    <p>
      To naviagate this manual, hover over it and use the primary action key
      (default: R) to move forward a page, or the secondary action key (default:
      CTRL-R) to move back a page.
    </p>
    <h2>Importing Preconstructed Decks</h2>
    <p>
      The easiest way to get started with TTPMTG is to get your hands on an
      official precon deck and get playing!
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the command <span class="tt">/deck &lt;name&gt;</span> to
      import a precon deck, where <span class="tt">&lt;name&gt;</span> is the
      full name of the deck you want to play with. Use double quotes around the
      pack's name if the name of the pack consists of multiple words. Once you
      do that, the deck will appear under your cursor!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't know which deck to grab? No problem! Use the command
      <span class="tt">/decks [terms]</span> to search for decks you might want
      to play. <span class="tt">[terms]</span> is an optional argument, but if
      provided, will narrow down the list of decks the command will show you.
      You can search by both set code and deck name! Once you have the deck's
      name, you can import it by passing that full name to
      <span class="tt">/deck</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Importing Custom Decks/Cubes</h2>
    <p>
      You may notice that by default, there's no cards laying around on the
      table. Don't worry, though; you can quickly import any deck you have, from
      a variety of sites, right onto TTPMTG!
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, use the command <span class="tt">/import &lt;url&gt;</span>,
      where <span class="tt">&lt;url&gt;</span> is the full URL to the deck you
      want to import! Sites you can use to import decks and cubes include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://archidekt.com/">Archidekt</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com">MTG Goldfish</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://moxfield.com">Moxfield</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://aetherhub.com">Aetherhub</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://deckstats.net">Deckstats</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://mtgtop8.com">MTGTOP8</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://mtgvault.com">MTG Vault</a></li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Generating Booster Packs</h2>
    <p>
      Do you want to host a draft or sealed event, or just want to crack some
      packs? We have you covered!
    </p>
    <p>
      To generate booster packs, use the command
      <span class="tt">/pack &lt;name&gt; [qty]</span>, where
      <span class="tt">&lt;name&gt;</span> is either the full name of the pack
      OR the pack's set code, and <span class="tt">[qty]</span> is optional, and
      if provided, allows you to tell it to generate mutliple packs at once.
      Much like with precon decks, you'll need double quotes for multi-word
      packs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much like precon decks, you can search for Magic sets to generate packs
      from. This is done via the command <span class="tt">/sets [terms]</span>.
      <span class="tt">[terms]</span> is an optional argument, but if provided,
      will narrow down the list of sets the command will show you. You can
      search by both set code and set name here as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do note that the pack generator is not collation-accurate at this time;
      you may be able to get duplicates of the same card in a pack, among other
      things. However, this generator does respect the chances and proportions
      of each rarity in each pack correctly.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can edit the number on life counters directly by clicking on the
        number in the floating UI above it.
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can increment, decrement, or even multiply/divide your life
            total by entering an operator before the number. For example, typing
            in <span class="tt">+5</span> in that box will add 5 to your life
            total.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you need to set your life total to a negative value, type
            <span class="tt">=</span> before the number. (Normally, the text
            entry will interpret negative numbers as you wanting to subtract
            something from your life total.)
          </li>
          <li>
            You don't have to use life counters just for counting life. You can
            use it to count a large amount of counters on a card, keep track of
            your storm count, or whatever else! You can create more life
            counters from the object library.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the primary action key (default: R) to tap/untap single cards.
        Don't try this on stacks of cards, or you'll shuffle the stack instead!
        (This is a feature, not a bug.)
      </li>
      <li>
        If you need to place a single card into the world, rather than importing
        from a website, you can create a blank card from the object library.
        From there, you can right-click it and select
        <span class="tt">Set card...</span>. This will open a hovering dialog
        that allows you to search for cards to add to the game.
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can also select <span class="tt">Add card...</span> to an
            existing stack of cards to add new cards to that stack via name
            search.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        You have available a variety of counters at your disposal! You can
        quickly make a copy of an existing counter by pressing the primary
        action key (default: R) while hovering over them.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have a card that makes tokens, and you want the tokens it makes,
        you can create them quickly! Just right-click the card and select "Get
        Related Tokens".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pressing the number keys to take cards off the top of the deck is
        broken. A bugfix is pending on Plasticity Studios's end, but for now,
        draw your cards manually.
      </li>
      <li>
        There's some graphical flickering when moving your cursor away from your
        life counter. No idea what's causing that whatsoever. It shouldn't
        affect the usability of the life counters.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are some issues that occur when a stack of cards has a mix of
        flipped and unflipped cards. As such, stacking of flipped and unflipped
        cards has been temporarily disabled.
      </li>
    </ul>
